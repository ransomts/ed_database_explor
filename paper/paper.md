# Summary

Systematic literature reviews require the researcher to decide search terms fairly early in the process. For the PRISMA framework, it is performed in the <insert number of step> step, early in the process. Other frameworks which are based on PRISMA such as JARS or PRISMA-P also require search term selection early in the process. 

The phrasing of this step varies across the frameworks, but data collection and selection is a critical if generic step in any research.
