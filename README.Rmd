litExplor is made to help researchers get an feeling for the amount of literature already out there for a literature review. 

The context that led to this package:
1. Decide to start a literature review
2. Meet with collaborators to brainstorm search terms
3. Manually put the same search terms into many databases
   - Some terms were more fruitful than others
   - Some terms had almost nothing written and were removed
   - Some terms dominated results and needed removed


## Installation

You can install the development version of litExplor from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ransomts/litExplor")
```

## Example

Start the dialog either from the Addins menu in rstudio or with a call to `litExplor()`

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->
